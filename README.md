react: core.

react-router-dom: this is used for routing.

redux: It's used for state management.

redux-thunk: Redux Thunk middleware allows us to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met.

axios: for fetching data.

styled-components: for styling components.

framer-motion: This is used for animating some elements.

RAWG api: This is a awesome api about video game's information.
